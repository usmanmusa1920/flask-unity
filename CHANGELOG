Also I refactor other libraries that this package needs with their corresponding versions in the setup.py and requirements.txt files. In this release good documentations is well packed.

Database migration is added using `alembic`

Some error pages, default page were added but still you can customise it in your project sub folder (the package with the same name of your project in your project directory) in a file called `route.py`. Also an admin directory within your project templates folder is added too!
